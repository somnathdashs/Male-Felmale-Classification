#  Male and Female classification With GUI Application intregation

A Deep Learning Model which used for classification of Male and Female. The Accuracy it reach upto 97%. It train on 25000 data where 12500 is Male's images and 12500 is Female's images.



## Info

1) "Gender.h5" has reached to the accuracy upto 97% with 3 channel image run for 20 epochs. Shape it used is (1,60,60,3)

2) "Gender2.h5" has reached to the accuracy upto 98.5% with 3 channel image run for 20 epochs. Shape it used is (1,128,128,3)

Loss :- Sparse_categorical_crossentropy

Activatiion on last layer :- softmax

Hence, Both are train on a different image size that are:
        1) Model 1: 60px / 60px
        1) Model 2: 128px / 128px
